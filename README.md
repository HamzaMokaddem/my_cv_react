React Static Template
Description
React Static Template is a boilerplate for React apps that has a simple one-page layout (no routing), markdown compatibility, and plays well with GitHub pages.

This project is inspired by React Static Boilerplate. The Webpack and Node.js configuration, as well as the markdown loader, is borrowed and adapted from React Static Boilerplate.
